React Native promoted by facebook is a Javascript framework for rendering mobile application in iOS and Android. React is basically a javascript library for building user interfaces which targets mobile platforms. So the question is how good it is?

It is definitely an interesting framework that helps web developers to create robust mobile applications using their existing Javascript libraries. The bonus point over it is that: it is faster mobile development, more efficient code sharing across cross platforms like iOS, Android and the web without sacrificing the end user’s experience or application quality. If your developers can handle the uncertainty that comes with working with a new technology, and wants to develop mobile applications for more than just one platform, you should be looking at React Native.



As we know, the number of smartphone users is increasing day by day.  The number is increasing just because these devices fulfill the  requirements easily like entertainment, shopping, security and much  more. This increasing scenario inspires the developers to build more  mobile applications related to mobile payment systems, social  networking, etc. Mobile application development is recently a very big market and everyone is using their own Android or iOS mobile phones. But for companies who are developing Android and iOS apps together gets very high cost for their customers, because they have to develop individual applications for each platform and that makes their application cost high.

So Cross-Platform application development technology overcome this problem. React native provides Cross-platform  app development technology provides the multi-platform app development  by that develop the app that can run on multiple platforms with the same  content and functionality. Moreover, developers should require to have  vast knowledge of coding. Ultimately, this technology saves a lot more  time as well as money, the main reason why it is more popular among the  app developers.

Advantages of React Native:-

1) Effective for Developers:- While in development cycle when making changes, for web development one can roll out changes by refreshing the browser but in mobile development, you need to deploy the code-cycle each to implement the changes. It is not necessary to re-compile the entire application to be rebuilt every time you make changes.

2) Cost reduction and Code reuse:- By using React Native, you can use the same code for deployment on iOS as well as on Android. This takes you to huge saving in development time and money. As per the calculations 90% of the code can be reused between Android and iOS which is just too good, saving lot of time plus some extra time for modifications that’s it.

3) Easy and Live Reloading:- Testing is done every time when some change is made in the code written will reflect live in the mobile screen. With React Native, it removes the need of recompilation of the application each time a change has been made.If you have two windows opened – one containing the code and the other showing a mobile screen as a result of the code – you can immediately see the effect of what you have changed in one screen, on the other screen.

4) Best for mobile environments using debugging tools:- React native gives you benefit of using intelligent debugging tools which can be utilised of whatever text editor you prefer for Javascript editing. React native does not drive you to work Xcode to develop for iOS or Android. React native is superfast and is very well tuned to mobile devices.

Drawbacks :

The downside of the React native is that some features of iOS and Android are still not supported and the community still searching for the best practices.
React Native is still young, and the usual caveats that go along with working with new technologies apply here.

Final Conclusion :

React native is an interesting framework that helps web developers to create robust mobile applications using their existing Javascript libraries. The bonus point over it is that: it is faster mobile development, more efficient code sharing across cross platforms like iOS, Android and the web without sacrificing the end user’s experience or application quality. If your developers can handle the uncertainty that comes with working with a new technology, and wants to develop mobile applications for more than just one platform, you should be looking at React Native.
